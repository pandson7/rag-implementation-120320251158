# RAG Implementation Task Description

## Project Overview
Create a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation with a web interface for natural language question answering.

## User Requirements
- RAG implementation for document-based question answering
- Web interface with natural language input capability
- Display sample questions for user selection
- Allow both sample question selection and custom user input
- Use documents from "~/ea_sample_docs/rag_docs" folder as knowledge source
- Test functionality with sample questions
- Validate response accuracy using actual sourced documents (not simulated context)

## Validation Requirements
- Verify retrieved content contains comprehensive information, not just snippets
- Ensure AI responses are detailed and based on full document context
- Test with diverse question types (broad concepts, specific details, technical patterns)
- Fix any issues identified during testing
- Ensure sample tests return expected responses
- Start development server and launch webapp when ready

## Technical Requirements
- Set up all dependencies correctly
- Implement document ingestion from specified folder
- Create vector embeddings for document retrieval
- Build web interface for question input and response display
- Include sample questions functionality
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation
